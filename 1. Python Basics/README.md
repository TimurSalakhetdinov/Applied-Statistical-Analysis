# Group 2 - Text Dictionary Creation

## Overview

This notebook (`Text_dictionary.ipynb`) demonstrates how to create a dictionary from a given text. The notebook explores two different methods to build and analyze word frequency and characteristics, such as length and word type. This approach is essential for understanding basic text processing and dictionary manipulations in Python.

## Key Methods

The notebook covers the following methods for creating a dictionary from text:

1. **Frequency-Based Dictionary**: 
   - Extracts individual words from a block of text.
   - Calculates the frequency of each word.
   - Stores the result in a dictionary where each word is a key, and its frequency is the value.

2. **Detailed Word Analysis Dictionary**:
   - Builds upon the frequency dictionary by including additional attributes for each word.
   - Stores word characteristics such as:
     - **Word Frequency**: Number of occurrences in the text.
     - **Word Length**: Number of characters in each word.
     - **Word Type (Noun, Verb, etc.)**: Classification of the word based on simple heuristics.

## How to Use This Notebook

1. **Prerequisites**: 
   - Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed.
   - Basic familiarity with Python dictionaries, string manipulation, and text processing.

2. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Download or clone this repository.
   - Open `Text_diction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Follow the cells sequentially to learn each method of dictionary creation and analysis.

3. **Practice Suggestions**:
   - Experiment with different blocks of text to see how the dictionary changes.
   - Modify the code to add more attributes to each word, such as position in text or capitalization status.

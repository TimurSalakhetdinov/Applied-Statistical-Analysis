# Applied Statistical Analysis - Group 2

## Course Overview

Applied Statistical Data Analysis is a part of the Masterâ€™s program in Data Science, aimed at deepening the statistical and data analysis knowledge essential for advanced data science applications. This module builds upon foundational concepts, with a primary focus on Python programming for statistical analysis, reflecting the modern, data-driven approach to problem-solving.

This course is structured to enable students to independently analyze datasets and communicate insights through a clear narrative. Group 2 will engage in hands-on sessions, tackling various statistical methods, choosing suitable techniques, and combining them effectively to address complex analytical challenges. The goal is to strengthen practical coding skills and theoretical understanding across a variety of statistical methods.

## Learning Approach

An emergent classroom approach is used, where traditional passive lectures are replaced by interactive sessions and weekly assignments. Each week introduces different statistical concepts and methods, allowing students to progressively deepen their analytical skills and coding proficiency.

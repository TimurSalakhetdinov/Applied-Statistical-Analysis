# Applied Statistical Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of bricks with attributes such as color, shape, height, units, and age group. The objective is to explore and visualize the distribution of these features to understand the characteristics and trends among different brick types.

## Project Structure

- **Data Processing**: The dataset was loaded from an Excel file with multiple tables, merged based on key identifiers, and cleaned for analysis.
- **Visual Analysis**: Created visualizations to showcase the distribution of colors, shapes, units, height, and age group.
- **Insights**: Key insights were drawn from the analysis, identifying trends in color popularity, shape variety, and age group specificity.

## Visualizations

### Examples:
- **Distribution of Colors**: ![Colors](distribution_of_colours.png)
- **Distribution of Shapes**: ![Shapes](distribution_of_shapes.png)
- **Combined Plot (Units, Height, Age Group, Type)**: ![Combined Plot](distribution_of_units_height_age_type.png)
